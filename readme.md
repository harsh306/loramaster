## Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods for Large Language Models

This repository implements several efficient fine-tuning methods for large language models, including:
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): A method for fine-tuning large language models with low-rank decomposition.
- SoRA (Sparse LoRA): A method for fine-tuning large language models with sparse updates.
- VeRA (VeRA: Vector-based Random Matrix Adaptation): A method for fine-tuning large language models with vectors.
- AdaLoRA (Adaptive LoRA): A method for fine-tuning large language models with adaptive low-rank decomposition.
- LoRA-FA (LoRA with Frozen A): A method for fine-tuning large language models with frozen pre-trained weights and low-rank decomposition.

## Todo
- [ ] Add more efficient fine-tuning methods.
- [ ] Merge these weights with bacbone network or layers.
- [ ] Learning rate scheduler.
